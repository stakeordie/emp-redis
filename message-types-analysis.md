## Message Types to Keep

All current message types are needed for the system to function properly. The only difference is that `CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED` is present in TypeScript but not in Python models.

## Recommendation

1. Keep all existing message types
2. Add `CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED` to Python models for consistency
3. Update documentation to reflect direct client-hub communication model
